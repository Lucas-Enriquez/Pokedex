# Pokedex
A vanilla JS Pokedex

Welcome to my Project! this is a Pokedex I created just by using Vanilla JavaScript, Fetch API, PokeAPI, HTML5, SASS (and a bit of Bootstrap).

My project let the user search for the Pokémon they want manually and know their stats (hp, deffense, speed, etc).
In case you only wanted to watch a list of all Pokémon, you can click on the "Pokémon List" on the navbar, it shows a list of 24 pokemon per page.
